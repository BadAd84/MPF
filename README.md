# DICUI
This is my current progress on my C# Disc Image Creator UI.

I am using Disc Image Creator, created by Sarami, and would like to thanks him for this great software.

You can get the latest code and released on his github right here:
https://github.com/saramibreak/DiscImageCreator

I'm a hobbyist programmer, so this code might not be optimal, feel free to make your recommendation / Pull request.

I would like this project to be a community project, so if you have some time and knowledge to give, I'll be glad to add you to the contributor of this project :)
